#CREATE A LOAN CALCULATOR
#Calculate monthly payments with the following formula: M=L[i(1+i)n]/[(1+i)n-1] ; M=monthly payment; L=loan amount; i=interest rate (for an interest rate of 5%,i=0.05); n=number of payments

import math
L = int(input("Enter the cost of the loan :"))
i = int(input("Enter the interest rate :"))
n = int(input("Enter the number of Payments :"))
a = i * n * (1+i)
b = (1+i) * n - 1
c = a / b
M = L * c
print("Monthly Payment :" + str(M))
