#Calculate Shipping charges for a shopper
#Ask the user to enter the amount for their total purchase.
#If their total is under $50 and $10 , otherwise shipping is free.
#Tell the user their final total including shipping costs and format the number so it looks like a monetary value.
#Don't forget to test your solution with: a value >50 ,a value <50 ,a value of exactly 50

import math
purchase = int(input("Enter the amount for their total purchase :"))
if purchase < 50 and 10 :
    print("That will be an extra $10")
    purchase += 10
    print("Total Amount")
    print(purchase)
else :
      print("Enjoy your free shipping")
print("Have a Nice Day")
